# Humpback-Whale-Identification
# Humpback Whale Identification Challenge
Welcome to the Humpback Whale Identification Challenge! This project aims to develop machine learning models to identify individual humpback whales based on images of their flukes. By accurately classifying whale fluke images, we can contribute to the conservation and monitoring efforts of humpback whale populations.

# About the Challenge
The Humpback Whale Identification Challenge was hosted on Kaggle and provided a dataset of whale fluke images along with labels indicating the identities of individual whales. Participants were tasked with building machine learning models that could classify new images into the correct whale categories.

# Project Goals
Develop machine learning models for humpback whale identification.
Contribute to wildlife conservation efforts through accurate whale population monitoring.
Explore and apply advanced image classification and deep learning techniques.
Dataset
The dataset consists of images of humpback whale flukes, along with corresponding labels indicating the identities of individual whales. It is available for download on the Kaggle platform.

# Getting Started
